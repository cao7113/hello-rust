# Notes

* The tuple without any values has a special name, unit. This value and its corresponding type are both written () and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they donâ€™t return any other value.
* Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
